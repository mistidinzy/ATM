**Author**: Misti Dinzy

**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for a 401 Level class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->

I am creating a bank "ATM" program within a console application.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

1. ‼️ Begin with TDD - Test Driven Development. Write out all tests **first**. ‼️
2. Build out a **BankAccount** class.
3. Build a console application that imitates the functionality of an ATM, using that **BankAccount** class.

### Solution will include

* Class: BankAccount
    * private decimal field
    * Method: decimal GetBalance()
    * Method: void Deposit()
    * Method: void Withdraw()

## Example
<!-- Show them what looks like and how how to use the application.  -->

_____

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->

I will use Visual Studio to write my code, using C# as the language, and .NET 5.0 as the runtime.
